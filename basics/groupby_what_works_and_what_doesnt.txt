The following will NOT work: 

select country,release_year,budget, count(*) as u_count
from films
where country not in ('USA','UK','France') and budget > 10000000
group by country, release_year
order by u_count desc,country desc;

No output - your code generated an error.
column "films.budget" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
LINE 1: select country,release_year,budget, count(*) as u_count

To solve this issue:
1. we can aggregate budget OR
2. include budget in the group by

select country,release_year,sum(budget), count(*) as u_count
from films
where country not in ('USA','UK','France') and budget > 10000000
group by country, release_year
order by u_count desc,country desc;

select country,release_year, budget, count(*) as u_count
from films
where country in ('Spain') and budget > 10000000
group by country, release_year, budget
order by u_count desc,country desc;
